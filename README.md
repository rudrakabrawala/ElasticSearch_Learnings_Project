# ElasticSearch Learning Journey üöÄ

## About Me

I am **Rudra Kabrawala**, a BTech Computer Science 3rd year student at **NMIMS**. This repository documents my complete journey of learning ElasticSearch from absolute scratch - from understanding what it is to building real-world applications with Python integration.

## My Learning Path Overview

When I started this journey, I had zero knowledge about search engines, distributed systems, or how companies like Amazon and Google handle millions of search queries. This README documents every step I took, every concept I learned, and every challenge I overcame.

## Chapter 1: Understanding ElasticSearch üîç

### What is ElasticSearch?

ElasticSearch is a **distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine** built on Apache Lucene. Think of it as a super-powered search system that can handle massive amounts of data and return results in milliseconds.

**Simple Analogy**: If your data is like books in a massive library, ElasticSearch is like having a brilliant librarian who can instantly find any book based on any criteria - title, author, content, or even a single word inside any page.

### Key Features I Discovered:

- **Distributed and highly available search engine** - Works across multiple servers
- **Schema-free JSON documents** - No rigid database tables needed
- **Near real-time search** - See results almost instantly after adding data
- **Powerful query DSL (Domain Specific Language)** - Flexible search capabilities
- **Analytics capabilities with aggregations** - Generate insights from your data

### Why I Chose to Learn ElasticSearch:

1. **Industry Relevance**: Used by Netflix, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and thousands of companies
2. **Career Growth**: High demand for search and analytics skills
3. **Practical Applications**: E-commerce, logging, monitoring, business intelligence
4. **Modern Architecture**: Understanding distributed systems is crucial for any developer

## Chapter 3: Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- ElasticSearch 7.17.4
- Docker (for running ElasticSearch)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudrakabrawala/ElasticSearch_Learnings_Project.git
cd ElasticSearch_Learnings_Project
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start ElasticSearch using Docker:
```bash
docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 \
    -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
    -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
    docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.17.4
```

### Basic Usage

1. Initialize the client:
```python
from elasticsearch.clients.sync_client import EcommerceElasticClient

# Create client instance
client = EcommerceElasticClient()
```

2. Create the product index:
```python
client.create_product_index()
```

3. Index a product:
```python
product = {
    "Name": "Sample Product",
    "Description": "Product description",
    "Category": "Electronics",
    "Price": 99.99,
    "StockQty": 100,
    "Brand": "Sample Brand"
}
client.create_product(product)
```

4. Search for products:
```python
# Search by name
results = client.search_products_by_name("laptop", fuzzy=True)

# Search by price range
results = client.search_by_price_range(100, 500)

# Search by category
results = client.search_by_category("Electronics")
```

### Asynchronous Operations

For better performance with bulk operations:

```python
from elasticsearch.clients.async_client import AsyncEcommerceClient

# Create async client
client = AsyncEcommerceClient(max_workers=10)

# Bulk index products
products = generate_product_data(100)
future = client.async_bulk_index(products)

# Wait for completion
results = client.wait_for_all_operations()
```

For a complete example, check out the [demo.py](demo.py) file in the repository.
